                  The Saptarishi or seven sages of Sanathan Dharma are the mind

                <p>
                  According to mythology, Lord Shiva killed a mighty demon named
                  Tripurasura on this day. Due to this the gods got freedom from
                  the atrocities of this demon and the gods were happy and named
                  Lord Shiva as Tripurari.

                  Lord Shiva's throat turned blue after drinking the poison
                  named Kalkut, which came out of the churning of the ocean, due
                  to which he was called Neelkanth. Mahadev had saved this world
                  only by drinking this poison.

                  Everyone was surprised when Shivji brought the procession.
                  Because there were ghosts and spirits in Shankar ji's
                  procession, because Shivji is favored by the gods as well as
                  the demons.

                  Worshiping Rudrasagar, which is included in the seven seas of
                  the religious city of Ujjain, has special significance. It is
                  believed that the worries of seven births go away just by
                  seeing the Rudrasagar behind the Mahakal temple.
