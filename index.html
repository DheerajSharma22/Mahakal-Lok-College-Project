            <h3 class="history-heading">History Mahakaleshwar Ujjain</h3>
            <p>
              When did the Mahakala temple first come in existence, is difficult
              to tell. However, the event may be assigned to the Pre-historic
              period. Puranas narrate that it was first established by Prajapita
              Brahma. There is reference to the appointment of prince Kumarasena
              by king Chanda Pradyota in 6th c. BC for looking after the law and
              order situations of Mahakala temple. The punch-marked coins of
              Ujjain, belonging to 4th-3rd c. BC, bear the figure of Lord Siva
              on them. Mahakala temple is also mentioned in several ancient
              Indian poetic texts. According to these texts, the temple had been
              very magnificent and magnanimous. Its foundation and platform were
              built of stones. The temple rested on the wooden pillars. There
              had been no sikharas on the temples prior to the Gupta period. The
              roofs of temples had mostly been flat. Possibly due to this fact,
              Kalidasa in Raghuvansam described this temple as ‘Niketana’. The
              palace of the king had been in the vicinity of the temple. In the
              early part of the Meghadutam (Purva Megha), Kalidasa gives a
              fascinating description of the Mahakala temple. It appears that
              this Chandisvara temple might have been a unique example of the
              then art and architecture. It may be ascertained that how splendid
              had been the temple of the main Deity of that town which possessed
              multi-storeyed gold-plated palaces and buildings and the superb
              artistic grandeur. The temple was enclosed by high ramparts
              attached with the entry-gates.At twilight the lively rows of
              glittering lamps enlightened the temple-complex. The whole
              atmosphere echoed with the sound of various musical instruments.
              Thecharming and well-decorated damsels added a lot in the
              aesthetic beauty of the temple. The echo of the Jaya-dhvani (Let
              the Lord be victories) of the assembly of the devotees was heard
              far and wide. Priests remained busy in worshipping the Deity and
              chanting eulogies. The Vedic hymns were recited and Stutis were
              sung, the painted walls and well-carved images projected the
              artistic heights of the day. After the downfall of the Gupta
              empire, several dynasties including the Maitrakas, Chalukyas,
              Later Guptas, Kalachuris, Pusyabhutis, Gurjara Pratiharas,
              Rastrakutas etc. dominated the political scenerio in Ujjain one
              after the other. However, all bowed down before Mahakala and
              distributed endowments and alms to the deserving. During this
              period a number of temples of various gods and goddesses,Tirthas,
              Kundas, Vapis and gardens took shape in Avantika. Several Saivite
              temples including those of 84 Mahadevas existed here. This fact
              should specifically be underlined that when every nook and corner
              of Ujjain was dominated by religious monuments housed by the
              images of their respective deities, the development and progress
              of Mahakala temple and its religiocultural milieu was not at all
              neglected. Among many of the poetic texts composed during this
              period, which sung the significance and glamour of the temple,
              Harsacharit and Kadambari of Banabhatta, Naisadhacharit of Sri
              Harsa, and Navasahasamkacharit of Padmagupta are noteworthy. It so
              appears that during rhw Paramara period, a series of crisis
              prevailed over Ujjain and the Mahakala temple. In the Eighth
              decade of Eleventh c. AD, one Gazanavide commander invaded Malwa,
              looted it brutally and destroyed many temples and images. But very
              soon the Paramaras rejuvenated every thing. A contemporary
              Mahakala Inscription testifies the fact that during the later
              Eleventh c. and early twelfth c., the Mahakala temple was re-built
              during the reign of Udayaditya and Naravarman. It was built in the
              Bhumija style of architecture, very favourite to the Paramaras.
