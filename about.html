            <p>
              When did the Mahakala temple first come in existence, is difficult
              to tell. However, the event may be assigned to the Pre-historic
              period. Puranas narrate that it was first established by Prajapita
              Brahma. There is reference to the appointment of prince Kumarasena
              by king Chanda Pradyota in 6th c. BC for looking after the law and
              order situations of Mahakala temple. The punch-marked coins of
              Ujjain, belonging to 4th-3rd c. BC, bear the figure of Lord Siva
              on them. Mahakala temple is also mentioned in several ancient
              Indian poetic texts. According to these texts, the temple had been
              very magnificent and magnanimous.Its foundation and platform were
              built of stones. The temple rested on the wooden pillars.There had
              been no sikharas on the temples prior to the Gupta period. The
              roofs of temples had mostly been flat.Possibly due to this fact,
              Kalidasa in Raghuvansam described this temple as ‘Niketana’.The
              palace of the king had been in the vicinity of the temple. In the
              early part of the Meghadutam (Purva Megha),Kalidasa gives a
              fascinating description of the Mahakala temple. It appears that
              this Chandisvara temple might have been a unique example of the
              then art and architecture. It may be ascertained that how splendid
              had been the temple of the main Deity of that town which
              possessedmulti-storeyed gold-plated palaces and buildings and the
              superb artistic grandeur. The temple was enclosed by high ramparts
              attached with the entry-gates.At twilight the lively rows of
              glittering lamps enlightened the temple-complex.
